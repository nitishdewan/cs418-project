# CS 418: Data Science Project

## To setup the project download the data and models folder from xxx and place it in the project directory. Place "raw_books" inside data_collection folder.

The data folder already contains all the preprocessed data and stored as pickle files. All the models can be run using these pickle files. Run each of the embedding cells and correspondingly run the modeling training cells in ```RunModels.ipynb```
